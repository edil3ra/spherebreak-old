* Spherebreak build with elm
  https://edil3ra.github.io/games/spherebreak/
  First project build with elm, 
  It's a clone of the spherebreak (a mini game in final fantasy-x2 )
  
** Rules
  http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Sphere_Break

** What went right  
 + The Model and the view is well separated each view element has a mapper function with the model
 + The Coin, Coins, and Player type are well written and unit tested
 + The Update function has no side effect excepet for the first random generator that make it very easy to test
 + The application has few messages that represent the interaction with the games

** What went wrong
  - Bad organisation, i should have a model folder a view folder.
  - Probably too much code for what it does.
  - The view function has too much code.
  - Init module is stupid, it should has a Cmd, Sub, Message module instead.
  
** What i like about elm
  + Very easy to test
  + Excellent typesystem
  + Pure functional
  + Small core of principles (you can learn it in one week if you already know functional style programming)
  + Compilation make runtime error almost inexistant
  + Easy to debug with Debug.log
  + Very good package system
  + Scalable
  + Could replaced Angular or React
  
** What i dislike about elm
  - The format convention is weird for initialisation
  - Lack of example in documentation
  - Lack of tutorials
  - It seem like not enougth programmer are interested in elm (it's a shame)
