* Spherebreak build with elm
  https://edil3ra.github.io/games/spherebreak/
  First project build with elm, 
  It's a clone of the spherebreak (a mini game in final fantasy-x2 )
  
** Rules
  http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Sphere_Break

** What went right  
 + The model and the view are well separated.
 + Each view element has a mapper function with the model.
 + The Coin, Coins, and Player type are well written and unit tested.
 + The Update function has no side effect except for the first random generator, that make it very easy to test.
 + The application has few messages that represent the interaction with the games.

** What went wrong
  - Bad organisation, it should have a models and a views folder.
  - Probably too much code for what it does.
  - The View module has too much code.
  - Init module is stupid.
  - Cmd, Sub, Message, Init should have their own modules.
  
** What i like about elm
  + Easy to test.
  + Excellent type system.
  + Pure functional.
  + Small core of principles (you can learn it in one week if you already know functional style programming).
  + Compilation make runtime error almost inexistant.
  + Easy to debug with Debug.log.
  + Very good package system.
  + Scalable.
  + Good alternative to react or angular.
  
** What i dislike about elm
  - The format convention is weird for variable initialisation.
  - Lack of examples in the documentation.
  - Lack of tutorials.
  - It seem like not enougth developer are interested in elm (it's a shame).
